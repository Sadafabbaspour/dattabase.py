The design project of a database with two user and post models, where each user can create an infinite number of posts

Using SQLALchemy, ÙˆSQLite3
We used a Base variable to define the classes

We connect to the database with a variable called engine code
We define an example of the ses class, which uses it to store the user and posts in the database
